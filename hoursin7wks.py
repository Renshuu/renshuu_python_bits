# Write Python code that prints out the number of hours in 7 weeks.

hour = 1
day = 24 * hour
week = 7 * day
answer = week * 7
print answer

# So, the teacher's answer to this problem simply put print and then the math to get the answer.
# Where's the fun in that when you've already learned about strings and variables?
